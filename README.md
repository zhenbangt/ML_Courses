# ML Course Notes

This is a repo for my commitments to some interesting CS subjects I take through Stanford Online (and some others), so that I can keep track of my progress

- 1 Jul 2020 - 15 Jul 2020 
	- Went through CS229 and part of problem set 1
- 15 Jul 2020 - 31 July 2020
	- Prepare for my final exams... ~~(definitely not an excuse for doing nothing)~~
- 1 Aug 2020 - 7 Aug 2020
	- Warm up/Review some Deep Learning through [MIT 6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)  ~~Got to prepare for job interviews~~ Too fun, can't resist doing it
 	- Refresh and learn some SQL/Java
	- [Deep Evidental Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02600.pdf), 
	
- 8 Aug 2020 - 19 Aug 2020
  	- Coursera Deep Learning Specialisation; Stanford CS230
	
- 25 Aug 2020
  	- Stanford CS230 Lec 8 is gold :/ excellent guideline for future career development
	- next question: What is defined as important/meaninngful work? What is defined as a good AI team?
	- some of the most exciting work to be done is to also look outside of the tech industry, and look at the traditional industries that do not have shiny tech thing,
	the value creation there may be even bigger 
	- (notice how large tech companies are working at the same problem, just as so many people are mining bitcoins. They still worth a lot, but you can create more value by mining ethereum)
	- examples: manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare
